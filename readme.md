# TODO
Unit tests
- Ensure 100% code coverage
- Do performance metrics by testing tons of randomized inputs
- Pre-randomize said inputs and use them in another context like Maya, GL or glm so we can immediately use them as test validation

Mat44Frustum
Mat44PerspectiveX
Mat44PerspectiveY
Mat44OrthoSymmetric
Mat44Orthographic
Mat44Lerp ? this seems hardly worthwhile and probably just becomes converting to xform, lerping that, and converting back

/*
These seem relevant if we want to black box the structures
which may be more relevant when passing pointers around
but for now I hope we can either copy low level c-style structs
or somehow share memory so we can pass by const ref everywhere.
This will get more defined when writing the py and cs wrappers

Mat44 Mat44Column // get single column
Mat44 Mat44SetColumn // set single column
Mat44 Mat44Item // get single item from a [0, 16) index
Mat44 Mat44SetItem // set single item from a [0, 16) index
Mat44 Mat44Item2 // get single item from col, row index pair
Mat44 Mat44SetItem2 // set single item from col, row index pair
Quat QuatItem
Quat QuatSetItem

# About
General rules:

We use radians at all times, globals for PI, TAU, DEG2RAD and RAD2DEG are defined for you in Math.h

We aim for modern CPUs, so compile for AVX2 or expect having to implement missing intrinsics.

For matrices:
We follow OpenGL and Maya memory layout, this is to say a transformation matrix
is 4 contiguous vectors where translation occupy the 13, 14, 15 indices.

OpenGL documentation uses 'column-major' notation.
This means that when the openGL spec says a translation matrix looks like:
1 0 0 x
0 1 0 y
0 0 1 z
0 0 0 1
The in-memory representation is this:
1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 x y z 1
(so naively inserting newlines results in something that looks transposed)

Mmaa documentation uses 'row-major' notation, so they put line breaks as you might
expect and note a translation matrix as:
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
x y z 1

Again the memory layout is 100% identical!

We post-multiply, mostly to match Maya's rotation order notation.
So rotate-order XYZ results in X * Y * Z, easier to perform.
Post multiplication means child * parent, and as Maya's translate moves the node in
parent-space it is also scale * rotate * translate. This matches the Maya documentation,
so if you were to go for the full maya implementation with pivots and shearing you
could directly refer to the multiplication order defined in MTransformationmatrix .

Our camera math also follows openGL and Maya meaning that by default the camera
looks in negative Z, Y is the default up vector and the default rotate order is XYZ
so that any Z consitutes a roll around the local forward axis (after applying X and Y).

Naturally this will all be customizable through arguments.

This would not exist without some great resources that I've used over the years.
Some of which I used on a regular basis while developing this to fill gaps in my knowledge or find reference implementations.

NOTICE! 'euclideanspace' code is released under the GPL2 and GPL3, which requires distributions in binary form to also disclose source.
All these routines have been superseded by more elaborate versions (e.g. rotate order independent and/or SIMD),
the original code remains between #if 0 defines so they will not end up in your binary, if you were to use these
legacy routines you are subject to the GPL2 or GPL3 license.

Some quaternion code was taken from Autodesk's animx library:
https://github.com/Autodesk/animx/blob/master/src/internal/Tquaternion.h
The original code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license

This license requires me to list my modifications to Tquaternion.h, and the modified version in MMath is distributed as part of MMath and is exclusively licensed under the same license as the rest of MMath.

I have taken the following methods: 

void Tquaternion::convertToMatrix(T4dDblMatrix& tm) const
Was converted to a global c-style function taking a Quat as argument (instead of the implicit this) and made to interact with my data structures in order to compile.
Later a SIMD version was created and the resulting functions retains none of the original code but follows the same algorithm.
The original code (after making it compatible with my data structures and compile succesfully) remains in the source, preprocessed away using #if 0 so it will not end up in binaries.

Tquaternion Tquaternion::operator*(const Tquaternion& rhs) const
Was converted to a global c-style function taking a Quat as argument (instead of the implicit this) and made to interact with my data structures in order to compile.
Due to discrepancies in the noutput when I created my SIMD version I cross referenced other sources and the algorithm behind the resulting code is slightly different.
The original code (after making it compatible with my data structures and compile succesfully) remains in the source, preprocessed away using #if 0 so it will not end up in binaries.

Tquaternion slerp(const Tquaternion& p, const Tquaternion& q, double t)
Was made to interact with my data structures in order to compile.
Later a SIMD version was created and the resulting functions retains none of the original code but follows the same algorithm.

Perpendicular vector algorithm was implemented as described by Ahmed Fasih here:
