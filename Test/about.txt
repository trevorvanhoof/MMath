Run maya_generate_json.py in Maya to generate these in and out json files
Then we use rapidjson to parse them and actually run countless of calls to the same functions
to see if they give results consistent with Maya, we check for average absolute error per element 
to be below a certain treshold, largely beacuse Maya is double precision and we're not.

Simply
#define TEST
in Source.cpp to go into unit-test mode,
without this define we're building a DLL and with this define we're building a unittext executable
Should probably split that up in two build targets.
